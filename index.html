<h3 class="post-title"><strong>Summer in Hamburg, Speechless, TENOR & Bespoke</strong></h3>
<div class="post-content">
       <p>
If I haven't seen you recently, you might not know that I'm spending the semester in Hamburg. I'm doing a PhD exchange at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg which has an amazing multimedia composition department, as well as performing the synth part in Cat Hope's opera Speechless!
So far it's been very busy, jumping straight into Speechless rehearsals as well as setting up my life here and dealing with all the paperwork that comes with moving to Germany (even just for a few months). I'm cooking up new collaboration ideas as well as sitting in on courses in VR, multimedia analysis and German classes.
I'm honoured to be a part of this performance of Speechless in the Ligeti Festival at HfMT Hamburg. It's an incredibly moving work. 
       <br>
        <br>
In May I'll have my first of a few side trips in the Northern Hemisphere. I'm heading to Boston May 15-17 for the International Conference on Technologies for Music Notation and Representation (TENOR), 
where I'll present a paper as well as having my piece Shadow Aria be performed by the amazing NYC ensemble loadbang. 
I'm very excited to share some of my early PhD research on methods of censorship in composition as well as to work with loadbang. 
       <br>
        <br>
Back in Australia and online, I'm happy to be taking part in Speak Percussion's Bespoke PD workshops this year. 
It's been an amazing chance so far to learn from and play with the incredible musicians and artists in and around Speak, including meeting 
the inspiring and hilarious Duré Dara. I look forward to seeing what else comes about through this opportunity!

<div class="post-content">
       <p>
        The last couple of months have been really busy. In addition to preparing to start my PhD, I’ve been working on a commission from
        RMIT and City of Melbourne for RMIT’s Black Box room – a 24.2 multichannel 3D speaker system. This is really my first time working in
        multichannel, and having 24 speakers in a 3D layout available to me is hugely different to making music in stereo. I researched Ambisonic sound,
        which is the technology used mainly for reproducing sound captured with an Ambisonic microphone or creating synthesised sounds for a virtual reality
        3D space. Since my piece doesn’t need to precisely replicate a real or imagined space, I didn’t attempt real Ambisonic spacialisation (although
        I would love to try it in future). Instead, I created 3D effects of sounds moving around the room by layering 2D octaphonic and quadraphonic
        panning effects in different directions and angles. Spacialisation really adds a whole other element of music to play with – each sound has new
        possibilities of movement and dimension, and there’s also a chance to let the audience interact with the work by hiding sounds in different corners
        of the room. I remember a workshop MESS hosted with Suzanne Ciani where she said that every music venue should have at least a quadraphonic or octaphonic
        speaker setup that performers can use. I completely agree with her because multichannel spacialisation has the potential to add so much excitement and
        impact to music, and I really hope I get to work in more multichannel systems throughout my career.
       <br>
       <br>
        In August, I attended the Darmstädter Ferienkurse which was hosted online. I had originally signed up to attend in 2020, but that was postponed
        and this year they decided to make the course and festival half online, with performers and concerts happening in Darmstadt but composition students
        online. Of course, it wasn’t the same as being there in person, and it was sad to think of all the pub nights and spontaneous jams missed. But I’m still
        really glad to have attended – my workshops and lessons with Jennifer Walshe, Cathy Milliken, David Helbich, Sebastian Berweck and Du Yun were incredibly
        inspirational and had me jotting down pages of new ideas and thoughts. I took part in the Minimoog Project, where Sebastian Berweck workshopped new pieces
        for solo Minimoog. An instrument rarely notated for, it was exciting to see everyone’s solutions and come up with my own. A common thread between many of
        the composers was thinking about how styles of notation affect the performance of a work. For me, writing a carefully notated score feels like giving a little
        gift to the performer, a secret artwork, and I handwrote my Minimoog piece with coloured pencils as a nod to early electronic composers like Eliane Radigue.

<h3 class="post-title"><strong>shallow listening in Sydney</strong></h3>
<div class="post-content">
       <p></a>
       <i>shallow listening</i> had its second and third performances recently by the music box project in Sydney. A year and a half after the premiere at
       BIFEM 2019, the fact that the ensemble were still excited about the program made me so grateful. The now award-winning performance, having recieved
        the Excellence in Experimental Music Award at the prestigious APRA AMC Awards in 2020, drew a new crowd in NSW. I was excited to see the ensemble
        perform my piece and the others in the unhinged program with even more energy and conviction and enhanced staging and lighting at Australian Hall.
       Thank you to Steve Moffatt at Limelight for the <a href=https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/reviews/shallow-listening-music-box-project><strong>rave review</strong></a>.
       <br>
       <br>
       <i>In contrast to the Zen-like calmness of that pillar, the other two works on the program were far more theatrical and demanding of both performers and
        audience. Shallow Listening features a terrific duet between Stefanou’s prodigious mezzo-soprano vocals and Jigalin’s theremin with some Cathy Berberian-style
        spoken and sung passages, heavy on dark humour with references to robodebt and the need to smile at all costs.</i>

                    Well, 2020 hasn't gone exactly as planned so far. By April this year, I'd planned to have already had my piece for Monash
                    Animated Notation Ensemble finished and performed at the Melbourne Recital Centre as part of the MSO Metropolis concert featuring
                    the works of Betsy Jolas. I would be preparing a piece for the Minimoog workshop at Darmstadt in July, and probably playing
                    more synth gigs around Melbourne. But, of course, this has turned out to be a year of putting things on hold. I'm starting to come to
                    terms with that, and make use of the extra time to compose more and tidy up recordings of some older works. Somehow there still doesn't
                    seem to be enough time in the day to do all the things I'm excited about.
                    <br><br>
                    Live-streaming has proven to be a double edged sword. I've had some amazing experiences with it - taking part in Deep listening
                    workshops with flautist Dom Chaseling and performing a
                    <a href="https://www.hibernationfestival.com/?wix-vod-video-id=59df23dcfaef4fba914332a32314b677&wix-vod-comp-id=comp-k8fqao6w&fbclid=IwAR0tuGXfQRVuqNNzuAwSMWxfiCaiZYDfTzlj_IhAGfCa7kodldtNesjv5WI"><strong>live-streamed synth improv</strong></a>
                    as part of the fabulous Hibernation Festival. I joined in on Pat Telfer's
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/TeK-RivzApA"><strong>Isolation Improvisation Collective</strong></a>,
                    improvising with musicians, dancers and artists over Zoom.
                    I've been grateful for all of these opportunities for performance, improvisation and human contact. However, online performances aren't as easy as I'd first
                    assumed. My internet connection isn't strong enough to sustain high quality video and audio streaming together, so I've always had to
                    work around this by prioritising one or the other, or limiting how many people I can play with. I guess we'll continue to work out the kinks
                    as online concerts become the norm for the next few months or more!
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, I've been playing with a new synth, the SOMA Lyra-8. It feels like it was made for me - it's designed by a Russian artist
                    who wanted to create an electronic instrument that allows the kind of musical and emotional range you'd get out of an acoustic instrument.
                    Although it looks like a noise box, it's really an 8-voice polyphonic keyboard with microtonal capabilities and a really cool modulating
                    delay. As well as the Hibernation Festival performance, I've recorded <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jaslynrobertson/5g-bats"><strong>
                    this piece</strong></a> called 5G Bats.

            I had an incredible time on the weekend with the music box project, who premiered
            my piece <i>Shallow Listening</i> at the Bendigo International Festival of
            Exploratory Music. After months of rehearsals the ensemble pulled off an amazing concert,
            with really effective lighting and choreography between the pieces. The concert consisted
            of pieces by Moya Henderson, Jasmin Leung, Elizabeth Jigalin, and Joseph Franklin as well
            as my piece. Tina Stefanou, the vocalist, did amazing work with costuming and Jane De Bourg
            built set pieces that took this performance from a regular concert to a fully realised
            show. I feel so lucky to have worked with them on this performance and really feel like
            part of the ensemble, not something I get to experience with every collaboration! My piece
            drew an appropriate amount of laughter from the audience, and the instrumentation of theremin,
            voice, toys, music boxes and other instruments seemed to work! Jigalin looked like she had
            suddenly embodied a 1930s thereminist when the concert started, and everyone locked in
            wonderfully to the improvised word prompt page in the middle of the piece, resulting in
            great comedic timing.

<h3 class="post-title"><strong>MESS Winter Sound School</strong></h3>
<div class="post-content">
      <p>
      This winter I've been spending most of my free time in a cold North Melbourne basement,
      <a href="https://mess.foundation"><strong>Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio</strong></a>. I was
        lucky enough to be accepted into their advanced professional development workshops,
        where I spent 13 weeks playing with vintage electronic instruments including the pictured
        Ondes Martenot, the Korg PS3300, Moog Theremin and the Buchla modular system. It was quite
        a leap out of my comfort zone to go quickly from my basic understanding of synthesis to very
        complex ideas about modular synthesis, MIDI to CV conversion and multi-channel mixing. My
        knowledge in this area has grown in a way that I hardly have time to keep up with - I just
        with I had more time to play around with all the ideas in my head! While taking this course,
        I also fed my new interests by listening to <a href="http://ubu.com/sound/leidecker.html"><strong>
        this broadcast</strong></a> about women in electronic music, and have found myself inspired by
        Daphne Oram, Johanna Beyer and Suzanne Ciani.
        <br><br>
        Some of my music from the course is already up on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jaslynrobertson/korg-ps3300-on-a-windy-afternoon">
        <strong>Soundcloud</strong></a>, with more to come as I get a grip on mixing and mastering
        and plan a Bandcamp release!

         <h3 class="post-title"><strong>MMASS</strong></h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>I spent this week at <a href="http://www.mmass.info/">Music
             Analysis Summer School</a>. Liz Jigalin,
             Jasmin Leung and I held a forum at the end of the week to discuss
             compositional issues with the many talented composers, musicians and analysts attending.
            Here's a paragraph I wrote on the question I posed to the group.
           <br><br>
           Posing the question ‘How do you communicate your sonic desires?’ to this room of diverse musical minds,
            the conversation turned to notation. This topic made quite evident the different approaches composers
            have to control over their music. Most seemed to use standard forms of notation, notes on paper with
            perhaps some graphics or text, handed out to musicians. We didn’t delve too much into the transfer of
            ideas from the score to realisation by musicians, but focused more on how our ‘sonic desires’ move from
            our heads to the page. Many in the room agreed that what’s harder than communicating desires is asking
            oneself, “What do I want in the first place?” Through the conversation, we found that it’s unavoidable
            for notation to become part of the compositional process. Before any sort of sketching of ideas, a
            realm of possibilities exist, and it’s only by putting pen to paper that we start to narrow down these
            options. As one young composer pointed out, this requires giving up your dreams of creating your
            ‘musical masterpiece’, as going from the initial idea state to something more concrete immediately
            opens your work up to limitations. The best advice I heard, though, was to be conscious of how much
            control you actually want over your music. The music of Julio Estrada, who we studied earlier in the week
            in a lecture by Pedro Alvarez, used to be portrayed through heavily detailed scores. In recent years, he’s
            communicated his music through talking directly to performers, abandoning traditional forms of notation
            entirely. What we finished the conversation on this topic with was a bold statement - that choices of
            notation are political. Composers need to be aware of the implications of their notation and make a stance.
