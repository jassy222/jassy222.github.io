          <p><br>Jaslyn Robertson is a queer multidisciplinary composer and artistic researcher. Her work evolves out of ideas and research, collaboration and experimentation. For others, her work is both ‘theatrical and demanding’ (Limelight) and ‘evokes a kind of anxiety, a kind of otherness, and yet a joy in this as well, through her creative use of modular synthesis, unconventional tunings, and unusual sounds’ (The Sound Barrier). 
<br><br>
           Driven by the excitement of learning new artistic skills, Jaslyn works with video, technology, spatialised audio and experimental forms of notation to realise her creative concepts. Working closely with improvising performers, artists, writers and fashion designers helps her to expand her reach and perspective. The aim of her work is to form multisensory performances that raise questions and unfold into discussion on complex social issues. A current focus of her practice and artistic research, culminating in a PhD in Music at Monash University, is queering concepts of censorship. She is developing an opera that unveils creative possibilities in restricted social environments. Through her work, she seeks to contribute to a wider discussion about self-censorship within structures of power.
<br><br>
The highlights of her musical career include winning the Homophonic Composition Prize, having works performed at BIFEM, MONA FOMA and the Deutsche Oper Berlin for Klangwerstatt Festival, opening for Jon Rose at Rouse Hill Psychedelia, and performing electronics in Cat Hope’s Speechless. She is currently part of Speak Percussion’s Bespoke program and an alumni of the Darmstädter Ferienkurse, Montreal Contemporary Music Lab, Toronto Creative Music Lab and the Australian Art Orchestra’s Creative Music Intensive. A 2023 exchange to the Hochschule für Musik und Theatre Hamburg expanded her presence in Germany and her multimedia composition skills, taking classes with Alexander Schubert. Composing for renowned performers including Ossicle Duo, Argonaut String Quartet, Kyla Matsuura-Miller, Tristram Williams, and members of Decibel New Music Ensemble, her music has been performed in festivals around the world.
