        The last couple of months have been really busy. In addition to preparing to start my PhD, I’ve been working on a commission from 
        RMIT and City of Melbourne for RMIT’s Black Box room – a 24.2 multichannel 3D speaker system. This is really my first time working in 
        multichannel, and having 24 speakers in a 3D layout available to me is hugely different to making music in stereo. I researched Ambisonic sound, 
        which is the technology used mainly for reproducing sound captured with an Ambisonic microphone or creating synthesised sounds for a virtual reality 
        3D space. Since my piece doesn’t need to precisely replicate a real or imagined space, I didn’t attempt real Ambisonic spacialisation (although 
        I would love to try it in future). Instead, I created 3D effects of sounds moving around the room by layering 2D octaphonic and quadraphonic 
        panning effects in different directions and angles. Spacialisation really adds a whole other element of music to play with – each sound has new 
        possibilities of movement and dimension, and there’s also a chance to let the audience interact with the work by hiding sounds in different corners 
        of the room. I remember a workshop MESS hosted with Suzanne Ciani where she said that every music venue should have at least a quadraphonic or octaphonic 
        speaker setup that performers can use. I completely agree with her because multichannel spacialisation has the potential to add so much excitement and 
        impact to music, and I really hope I get to work in more multichannel systems throughout my career.

        In August, I attended the Darmstädter Ferienkurse which was hosted online. I had originally signed up to attend in 2020, but that was postponed 
        and this year they decided to make the course and festival half online, with performers and concerts happening in Darmstadt but composition students 
        online. Of course, it wasn’t the same as being there in person, and it was sad to think of all the pub nights and spontaneous jams missed. But I’m still 
        really glad to have attended – my workshops and lessons with Jennifer Walshe, Cathy Milliken, David Helbich, Sebastian Berweck and Du Yun were incredibly 
        inspirational and had me jotting down pages of new ideas and thoughts. I took part in the Minimoog Project, where Sebastian Berweck workshopped new pieces 
        for solo Minimoog. An instrument rarely notated for, it was exciting to see everyone’s solutions and come up with my own. A common thread between many of 
        the composers was thinking about how styles of notation affect the performance of a work. For me, writing a carefully notated score feels like giving a little 
        gift to the performer, a secret artwork, and I handwrote my Minimoog piece with coloured pencils as a nod to early electronic composers like Eliane Radigue.
