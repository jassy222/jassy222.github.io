 <h3 class="post-title"><strong>Recording for <i>Cut It</i> at Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio</strong></h3>
<div class="post-content">
       <p>
        I’ve been working on the piece <i>Cut It</i> for Ossicle Duo since 2019. It was originally going to be performed in 2020, but was put on hold due to COVID restrictions and will now be premiered in 2022. Returning to a piece that I drafted so long ago is difficult, but it also gives me the opportunity to look at what I’ve written, consider what I was trying to express with the piece, and expand on it with the new insights coming from beginning my PhD research and a better understanding of electronic music. The piece is written for double bell trombone, percussion and pre-recorded electronic ‘tape’ track. Today, at MESS, I recorded with their new Erica SYNTRX analogue synthesizer.
<br><br>
      To start familiarising myself with the new synth, I recorded my first few takes of experimentation and mixed them into a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jaslynrobertson/possessed">short piece</a>. This helped me understand the unusual digital pin matrix patching system the SYNTRX uses, inspired by the interface of the EMS Synthi AKS. After getting my head around how the patching matrix works and working out a few interesting patches, I started recording the layers of sound. I was interested in exploring the idea of restrained noise, especially for <i>Cut It</i>, since the electronic track sometimes overtakes the instruments, but at other times rumbles below them. I was also excited to find that, like the Synthi, the SYNTRX reverb can pick up percussive tapping on the metal parts of the instrument. I recorded a lot of this tapping sound because I can imagine it blending in with and echoing the percussion part in an interesting way. 
<br><br>
      I recorded the first draft of the tape part for <i>Cut It</i> in lockdown, where I was limited by only being able to use the synthesizers I had at home and was still learning to use at the time. Coming to MESS, I wanted to start the process of replacing some of those sounds with better sounding instruments, and also to rethink the tape track. I had left a lot of long pauses in the electronics with the idea that the instruments would have a chance to solo, but in re-imagining the piece I wondered whether the gaps in the tape part would feel too awkward. I recorded some layers on the SYNTRX that continue for the whole piece, quietly in the sections that the acoustic instruments shine through more. Hopefully that will give the track more cohesion, and I can always edit parts out if I do feel the piece needs a break from electronics when I workshop the piece with Ossicle. I recorded a lot that will probably not make it into the final piece, but having more recorded sounds to play with will give me more options later on. <i>Cut It</i> was the first piece that started my exploration with expressing ideas about censorship in my music, and coming back to it, I want to make the personal and political statement in the work stronger by reflecting it intensely in the music. Transitioning between restrained noise and overtaking noise is one way the piece reflects the dichotomy of censorship as a necessary restriction and a prohibitive one. <br><br>
